=============================================

Most of this installation instruction is basic CPAN shell installation 
practice, but hey... If you think you don't need it, don't read it :o)


A) Install required OS libraries (make sure you have a working 
development environment: make, gcc, etc.)

Download latest SSL library (www.openssl.org), unpack, build and install

B) Install Net::DRI dependencies

1. open the CPAN shell:
    perl -MCPAN -e shell

If this is the first time, it will run the CPAN shell setup procedure. 
You can usually get away by accepting all the default values. Be aware 
that it should find most of the required binaries (tar, make, wget, etc.)

2. On the CPAN shell commandline install the dependencies which are 
listed in the README of the Net::DRI tarbal. Just type:

install <module name>

<module name> in this case can be e.g. DateTime (mind lower- and 
uppercase characters) It can also be a 'sub'-module like SOAP::Lite 
(also include the '::'!)

Whenever you install a module that is listed as dependency in the README 
it might depend on other modules as well. This will typically look 
something like:

---- Unsatisfied dependencies detected during 
[J/JH/JHOBLITT/DateTime-Format-ISO8601-0.0403.tar.gz] -----
     DateTime::Format::Builder
Shall I follow them and prepend them to the queue
of modules we are processing right now? [yes]

Just accept prepending them to the queue. (default)


My experience was that not all dependencies are properly detected like 
the example above. This can lead to those nasty errors during the 
test-phase of a module installation. E.g. during the installation of 
DateTime:

t/07compare.............ok 17/26Can't locate Class/Singleton.pm in @INC

The way I deal with them is:
Scroll back in the modules testing log and locate the missing module. In 
this case "Class/Singleton.pm" which is part of module Class::Singleton. 
(not hard to figure that out, right?)
Now first do:
install Class::Singleton

and after you've succesfuly installed this missing module, you can 
resume installing the module you wanted to install. In this case just 
type the installation line again:

install DateTime

NOTE. I found during the installtion of the Net::DRI dependency modules 
that I needed to additionally install the following modules. (yes, 
that's on top of all the official dependencies listed):

File::Find::Rule
Test::Pod
Class::Singleton
Net::SSLeay
MIME::Parser

So you might want to install these "just in case" before you run into 
errors. It won't harm your system if you do this without ever needing them.

As a last resort, when there seem to be no more missing dependencies but 
the test still lists errors, you might choose to do a 'forced' install:

force install SOAP::Lite

Only do this when you made sure there are no missing dependencies!
(Uhum.... I had to do this for one or two modules..... But hey, it works 
now)

C) Install the Net::DRI module

Finally we can install Net::DRI smoothly:

install Net::DRI

If the installation exits with "/usr/bin/make install  -- OK" 
there's nothing more standing between you and 
using the Net::DRI module. (Go treat yourself a beer)
